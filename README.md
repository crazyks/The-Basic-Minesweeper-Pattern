The-Basic-Minesweeper-Pattern
=============================

A basic minesweeper 3x3 pattern handbook for Android.

## What's this:  
This application shows all the basic minesweeper patterns in different directions. It helps people contribute the imagination (which describes the connection between a number and the mine cells around it) in his/her mind.  
To remember these patterns, especially the basic ones, is very important to a minesweeper player(gamer).  
## Why I wrote this app:  
The theory of minesweeper patterns was put forward by Xiaoyang Yang, a Chinese minesweeper player. He post his theory on saolei.net forum.  
I found it's helpful, but to remember the patterns is a little difficult for me. Because I have to work during the day, sometimes the work will be continued into the night.  
I like minesweeper game very much and most of my spare time is on the bus or metro. So I decided to write this application.
